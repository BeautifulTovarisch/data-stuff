# Data Stuff

A throwaway repository to house random Python and/or Gnuplot scripts as I learn
the basics of data modeling.

## Overview

This repository contains mainly two things:

- Python Scripts
- Gnuplot data/scripts

That I have found the time to create when working through a textbook on applied
Calculus.

## Software

|Software|Version|
|--------|-------|
|Python  |3.8.10 |
|Gnuplot |5.2.8  |
